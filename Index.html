    Here are the test commands for git.
    git init - Used for defining/converting a folder/file into git.
    git status- gives the staus of the git.
    git remote add origin <link paste>- here remote means git hub.
    Origin is the file at which we are making changes.

    git branch- provides the branch in which we are present.
    git commit -m "msg"= this helps in commit the changes to github
    git push origin main - used to push the changes from local to remote or github (name of the file is origin. If we change the file name from origin to something else. Then, something else has to used) 
    # General Workflow for local git:
    # GitHub Repo> Clone> Changes> add> Commit> push
    # Git branches: creating a copy of main and then making changes accordingly. 
    # These branches are later merged into the main branch.
    
    git branch -d branchname= this is used to create a new branch with the defined name
    # We created a nea branch with name: Feature1.
    git checkout= used to move in/out of the branch.
    git branch -d branchname= used to delete a branch. You cannot delete a branch in which you are present.
    # You need to move out of a branch then you can delete the branch
